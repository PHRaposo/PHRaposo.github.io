Adam Blog 2.0 is a Jekyll theme that was built to be 100% compatible with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). If you are unfamiliar with GitHub Pages, you can check out [their documentation](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) for more information. [Jonathan McGlone's guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) on creating and hosting a personal site on GitHub is also a good resource.
